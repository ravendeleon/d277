        <h2 class="city">About the City of Austin</h2>
        <p>Situated in Central Texas at the eastern edge of the American Southwest, Austin serves as the capital of
            Texas, known as the Lone Star State.
            The city's origins trace back to the 1830s, when Anglo-American settlers first arrived in what was then
            Mexican territory.
            In 1837, they established the village of Waterloo along the Colorado River, marking the area's first
            permanent settlement.
            By 1839, Waterloo had been renamed Austin and designated the capital of the Republic of Texas.
            The city was named in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas."</p>

            in scenic spots and attending outdoor events, Austin knows how to make the most of this bright season. As
            the temperatures rise and festivals fill the calendar, many Austinites enjoy spending their spring evenings
