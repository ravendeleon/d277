        <p>Vibrant and diverse, Houston is a lively blend of creativity, talent, and top-notch attractions, establishing
            itself as a world-class city. Founded on August 30, 1836, by brothers Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby
            Allen near Buffalo Bayou, Houston boasts a robust economy, stunning landscapes, and a population brimming
            with hope and energy, making it a sought-after international destination. As of July 2018, it ranks as the
            fourth most populous city in the U.S. with an estimated population of 2,325,502, trailing only New York, Los
            Angeles, and Chicago, and is the largest city in both the southern U.S. and Texas. Projections indicate that
            Houston will rise to become the third most populous U.S. city during the latter half of the 2020s.</p>
